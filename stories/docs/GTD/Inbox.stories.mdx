# Inbox

The inbox is where all the *stuff* goes. All of the emails, conversations, thoughts,
mail, phonecalls, everything should end up in here. It doesn't (shouldn't) be terribly
lengthy but enough time should be spent to avoid needing to think a lot about what the
heck it means.


## One Day...â„¢ Features

- Check the length of an inbox item, it should be more than a word
- Prompting list that gives ideas that should be here
- Import? Perhaps we can receive things via forwarded emails
